Hi, you might be wondering why the URP package is here. 
We decided to change a behaviour of URP's pixel perfect camera by tampering with the source code. Unfortunately, unless the entire package is specified here, Unity will deem our version of the package faulty and attempt to wipe it and reinstall the "official" version.
